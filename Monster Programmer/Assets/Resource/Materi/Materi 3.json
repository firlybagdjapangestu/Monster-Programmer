    "Polymorphism means 'many forms'. It allows the same method name to behave differently based on the object calling it.",
    "For example, a method called `Speak()` might make a Dog bark and a Cat meow. Same method name, different behavior.",
    "There are two types of polymorphism: Compile-time (method overloading) and Runtime (method overriding).",
    "Method overloading happens when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters.",
    "Method overriding happens when a child class redefines a method from the parent class.",
    "Polymorphism improves code flexibility and makes programs easier to extend and maintain."
