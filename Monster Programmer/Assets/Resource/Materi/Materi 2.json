    "Inheritance allows one class to use the properties and methods of another class. The class that inherits is called the child or derived class.",
    "The original class is called the parent or base class. It contains common logic that can be reused by child classes.",
    "For example, a `Vehicle` class might have a method `Move()`. A `Car` class can inherit from `Vehicle` and use `Move()` without writing it again.",
    "Inheritance reduces duplicate code and allows for better organization of related classes.",
    "Child classes can also override methods from the base class to provide specific behavior."
