    "Encapsulation means wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) together inside a class.",
    "It protects the internal state of an object from being accessed or modified directly. Instead, data is accessed through methods.",
    "For example, instead of changing a personâ€™s age directly, you use a method like `SetAge(int age)` to update it.",
    "Encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public`.",
    "This principle improves security, prevents misuse, and keeps the code more organized and easier to manage."
