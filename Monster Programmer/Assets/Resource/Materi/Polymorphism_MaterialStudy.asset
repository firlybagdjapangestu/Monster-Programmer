  allSubject:
  - Polymorphism means 'many forms'. It allows the same method name to behave differently
    based on the object calling it.
  - For example, a method called `Speak()` might make a Dog bark and a Cat meow.
    Same method name, different behavior.
  - 'There are two types of polymorphism: Compile-time (method overloading) and Runtime
    (method overriding).'
  - Method overloading happens when multiple methods have the same name but different
    parameters.
  - Method overriding happens when a child class redefines a method from the parent
    class.
  - Polymorphism improves code flexibility and makes programs easier to extend and
    maintain.
