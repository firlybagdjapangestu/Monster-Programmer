  - Abstraction means focusing on what an object does, instead of how it does it.
    It hides unnecessary details and shows only essential features.
  - "In real life, when you drive a car, you use the steering wheel and pedals without
    knowing the internal engine mechanics. That\u2019s abstraction."
  - In programming, abstraction is done using abstract classes or interfaces. They
    define what should be done, but not how.
  - Abstraction helps reduce complexity. It allows developers to build complex systems
    by working with simplified models.
  - Using abstraction, programmers can design systems that are easy to maintain and
    extend without changing core logic.
