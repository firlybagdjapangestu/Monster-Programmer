    "Abstraction means focusing on what an object does, instead of how it does it. It hides unnecessary details and shows only essential features.",
    "In real life, when you drive a car, you use the steering wheel and pedals without knowing the internal engine mechanics. Thatâ€™s abstraction.",
    "In programming, abstraction is done using abstract classes or interfaces. They define what should be done, but not how.",
    "Abstraction helps reduce complexity. It allows developers to build complex systems by working with simplified models.",
    "Using abstraction, programmers can design systems that are easy to maintain and extend without changing core logic."
