  - Inheritance allows one class to use the properties and methods of another class.
    The class that inherits is called the child or derived class.
  - The original class is called the parent or base class. It contains common logic
    that can be reused by child classes.
  - For example, a `Vehicle` class might have a method `Move()`. A `Car` class can
    inherit from `Vehicle` and use `Move()` without writing it again.
  - Inheritance reduces duplicate code and allows for better organization of related
    classes.
  - Child classes can also override methods from the base class to provide specific
    behavior.
